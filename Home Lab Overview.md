# Cloud-Home-Lab
The purpose of this home lab is to test offensive and defensive operations in a practical cloud deployment.

I am running two cloud implementations in order to build a larger breadth and depth of understanding across platforms. This includes both AWS and Azure. I learned how to create this implementation primarily from the following YouTube walkthrough: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s_3oNwqImo

This video introuduced me to the following tools:
CloudGoat: https://github.com/RhinoSecurityLabs/cloudgoat
AzureGoat: https://github.com/ine-labs/AzureGoat
PurpleCloud: https://github.com/iknowjason/PurpleCloud

I will periodically update this repository as I play more with these tools in my home labs.
